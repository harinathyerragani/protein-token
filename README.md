### Overview

ProteinToken is a Solidity smart contract developed on the Ethereum blockchain. It facilitates the management of gym tokens used for redeeming various types of proteins. This README provides an overview of the contract's functionalities and usage.

### Features

- **Token Management**: The contract manages gym tokens, allowing for minting and burning of tokens.
- **Protein Redemption**: Gym tokens can be redeemed for different types of proteins, each with its associated cost.
- **Ownership Control**: The contract includes ownership control, ensuring only the owner can mint new tokens.
- **Token Transfer**: Tokens can be transferred between addresses, enabling seamless exchange among gym-goers.

### Usage

To deploy the contract, you need access to an Ethereum-compatible development environment, such as Hardhat or Truffle. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

1. **Contract Deployment**: Deploy the contract with an initial owner address.

2. **Token Minting**: Use the `mint` function to mint tokens and distribute them as needed.

3. **Token Burning**: Tokens can be destroyed using the `burn` function, ensuring token supply management.

4. **Protein Redemption**: Gym-goers can redeem tokens for proteins by calling the `redeemProtein` function with the desired protein type.

5. **Token Transfer**: Use the `transferTokens` function to transfer tokens between addresses.

### Testing

The contract includes test cases to ensure proper functionality and security. You can run these tests using a testing framework such as Hardhat or Truffle. Ensure to test various scenarios, including token minting, burning, protein redemption, and token transfers.

### Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Validate inputs thoroughly to prevent invalid transactions.
- **Access Control**: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict sensitive functions to authorized users.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test the contract under different scenarios to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
